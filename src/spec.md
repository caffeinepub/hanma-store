## Summary
**Goal:** Update Café 37 site branding (title/tagline), business hours, and SEO metadata to match the latest provided text and schedule.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all visible café name/tagline text across the site with: title “CAFE 37” and tagline “The ultimate hangout cafe” (e.g., Home hero, header/footer brand block, share text, and any tagline component).
- Update business hours everywhere they are displayed (Contact page and any other hours/closing-time UI such as footer and Home hero) to: Friday–Sunday 12 pm–12 am; Monday–Thursday 1 pm–12 am, matching the provided formatting.
- Update HTML metadata (document title, meta description, and Open Graph title/description) to reflect “CAFE 37” and “The ultimate hangout cafe” consistently.

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows the new “CAFE 37” branding and “The ultimate hangout cafe” tagline throughout, and displays the updated weekly hours consistently on the Contact page and other hours locations, with updated SEO/meta titles and descriptions.
