## Summary
**Goal:** Make the homepage hero food imagery look more colorful and premium while keeping the site’s overall color scheme unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Edit the existing homepage hero image so only the food items (e.g., chicken and other foods) have increased vibrance/saturation and a more premium-looking lighting/contrast.
- Update the Home page to use the newly edited hero image asset from `/assets/generated`.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home page hero image appears more vibrant and premium (food items only), while the rest of the website theme/colors remain exactly as before.
