The diff only modifies project_state.json to describe a set of existing features for an ICP canister-based e-commerce storefront template; with no stated requirements, no missing requirements can be identified. Because the change is purely to project metadata/description, it’s not possible to assert any hallucinated implemented features beyond documentation updates.",
